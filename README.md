# SOBER
SOBER for imbalanced learning

The implementation of Imbalanced Data Oversampling through Subspace Optimization with Bayesian Reinforcement (SOBER), which is under review in Artificial Intelligence Review. It generates synthetic samples using optimization, along with feature importance using Bayesian reinforcement. 
The following are the objects generated after oversampling
Oversampled dataset: oversample_result
Feature subspaces importance: br_itr_df_aggregate
Virtual observations generated during Bayesian reinforcement: historical_virtual_obs_agg_ref
Feature subspaces selection with concentration parameter (alpha): br_df_agg
